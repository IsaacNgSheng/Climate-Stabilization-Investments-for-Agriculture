## Overview

### Background
In an era of growing climate unpredictability, both investors and farmers face increased risks. Traditional reliance on seasonal patterns for investment decisions is no longer sufficient as climate variability disrupts agriculture. This project investigates how climate stabilization investments can mitigate these risks, enabling better predictions and fostering a resilient agricultural sector.

### Evolution of Focus
Initially, the project examined weather derivatives as a potential solution to hedge agricultural risks. However, due to the complexity and niche nature of these financial instruments, the focus shifted toward broader, more impactful strategies:
- **Climate Stabilization Technologies**: Examining how investments in green technologies can stabilize weather patterns and reduce risks.
- **Agricultural Productivity**: Exploring the cascading benefits of stabilized climates for local farmers and investors in Singapore.

### Roadmap
1. **Historical Context**: Review of commodities trading in Chicago and Singapore, and their responses to climate challenges.
2. **Technological Investments**: Analysis of technologies like green bonds and agri-tech solutions that promote stable agricultural outputs.
3. **Policy and Strategy Implications**: Recommendations for leveraging these investments to create a sustainable agricultural sector in Singapore.
